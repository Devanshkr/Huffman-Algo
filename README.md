# Huffman-Algo

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters to acheive compression. The webapp takes only .txt file as an input and returns a compressed file having lower size. To decompress, upload the compressed file and submit it.

Data structure used: Heap/priority queue.
Time complexity: O(NlogN)
