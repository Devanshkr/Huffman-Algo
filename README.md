# Text file compressor web app

Uses Huffman Coding for Text Compression
Made with JAVASCRIPT , HTML and CSS

About<br/>
Performs Lossless compression and decompression of .txt files using Huffman Coding technique.
Each character is assigned a unique variable length binary code, instead of its 8-bit representation, with more frequent characters having smaller codes. A Huffman Tree is created and stored to generate and decode these codes.
Compression ratio usually improves as the file size increases.
The website is made responsive (with HTML and CSS ) and interactive (with JavaScript).
An Info page is added to give more information about Huffman coding.

Data structure used: Heap/priority queue.
Time complexity: O(NlogN)
